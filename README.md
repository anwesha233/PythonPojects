In this growing age of virtual realities it is no wonder that everything can be 
simulated and programmed to make work easily and accurate. We have great 
tools to facilitate these requirements-Python being one of them. This high- level 
language is so versatile in itâ€™s application(AI,Data science to name a few) and so 
easy to work with that it has changed the face of technology and has facilitated 
programs to solve real life challenges.The scope of development of this 
programming language is immense and hence our choice of language was Python. 
Thanks to Anaconda which is a free and open-source distribution for Python 
programming language for scientific computing.The Spyder(version 3.7.8) 
integrated development environment was used that aims to simplify package 
management and deployment.The IPython console version 7.8.0 was used which 
supports a visual and graphical representation for the data. The basic idea was to 
generate names using R, G, B values, create algorithms to suggest complimenting 
colours and generating a colour palette containing the complimentary, analogous 
and triad colours based on the concept of the colour wheel.
